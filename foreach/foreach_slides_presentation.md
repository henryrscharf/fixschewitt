- this example is a lot of reps of teeny calculations. Might see better speed up if the reps were larger things. MCMC?
- need something more compelling for `iterators`
- more complicated example for `.combine`? mean?
- do their own code? fix some code?
- images for heavy analysis?
- model search? random forest? svm? other ML topics?
- references
- dorng in my bootstrap?
