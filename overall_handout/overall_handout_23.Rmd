# Section 1: the `foreach` package in R

## Learning goals
1. How to convert from a `for` loop to a `foreach` loop

# Section 2: The `parallel` package in R
This section will last approximately 30 minutes. Participants are encouraged to follow along on their laptops.

## Learning goals

1. When to use the `parallel` package in R
2. How to parallelize `apply` functions
3. How to parallelize a process that generates random numbers
4. How to parallelize bootstrapping (example)

## Extra materials (helpful, but not required)

1. Presentation slides: 
2. R script: \url{http://goo.gl/d2XDcF} <!-- github site -->

## Key ideas

1. The base R package `parallel` is a merger of `multicore` and `snow`.
2. For embarassingly parallel tasks, a small amount of effort can produce a large gain in efficiency.
3. Some care must be taken when parallelizing processes that involve random number generation.

# Section 3: Computing with R and Hadoop

This section will last approximately 40 minutes.  The first 20-25 minutes  introduces Hadoop and how people can use it with R, and the remaining 15-20 minutes walks participants through a demonstration lab.

## Learning goals

1. What Hadoop is
2. Current R/Hadoop integrations
3. *When* to use R with Hadoop (guidelines)
4. *How* to use R with Hadoop (lab)


## Extra materials (helpful, but not required)

1. Presentation slides: \url{http://goo.gl/Ew6jOP} <!-- github site -->
2. Virtual machine used to run R/Hadoop for the lab (requires ~4GB RAM): \url{http://goo.gl/R5Okcr}  <!-- Dropbox -->
3. Lab instructions: \url{http://goo.gl/6fkQr9} <!-- github site -->
4. Lab R script: \url{http://goo.gl/URPJdD} <!-- github site -->
5. PuTTY (SSH client for Windows): \url{http://goo.gl/vMv6ra}  <!-- PuTTY developer -->


## Key definitions

**Hadoop:**  Open source software for enabling distributed storage and computing capabilities on networked servers.

**MapReduce:** Hadoop's model for parallel programming.

**R:** Open source statistical computing software designed with strong built-in support for statistical needs like fitting models, making predictions, and drawing inferences.

**R/Hadoop integration:** Extra R packages that let practitioners run R code in Hadoop MapReduce jobs.


## Key ideas

1. R and Hadoop integrate best when using the strengths of both technologies.
2. R and Hadoop do not integrate well for all projects.  Simple data processing and iterative algorithms may be best implemented with other languages or  technologies.
3. Hadoop facilitates distributed computing with the MapReduce programming model.
