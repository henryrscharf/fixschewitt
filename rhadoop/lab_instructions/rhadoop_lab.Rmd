## Lab outline

GOAL: Make a data-driven business decision for an insurance company to start a new program.

1. Fit a logistic regression model to a small amount of data obtained from a pilot study of customer feedback data.
2. In a virtual cloud, use the ```RHadoop``` package to run a MapReduce job that summarizes which other customers the model predicts will provide positive feedback.

3. (Optional) Modify the MapReduce job to refine the analysis.
